# Phoenix-Solar
We want to build an aircraft, capable of continiuous solar powered flight. To achieve this, we need to overcome diffrent engineering challanges ranging from optimisation problems to basic mechanical engineering and electonics.

There is no detailed discription of the project yet, because we are busy building it.
